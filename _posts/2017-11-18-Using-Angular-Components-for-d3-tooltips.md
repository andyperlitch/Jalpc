I love using **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** as an SPA application framework because it has a solid templating engine, component-based organization, and built with TypeScript (there are many other great parts of Angular, but these are relevant for this post).

I love using **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)**  as a visualization library for its data-binding strategy, great out-of-the-box layouts, and fantastic animation support.

It is completely possible for the two libraries to work together ()
